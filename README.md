Chrono
======

Date/time functionality for GNU Octave.

This package attempts to provide a set of mostly-Matlab-compatible date/time classes and functions, including `datetime`, `duration`, and `calDuration`. It has support for time zones.

All the code in here is currently experimental. Do not use it in any production code!

## Installation and usage

Installation:

* Clone the repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/apjanke/octave-addons-chrono`

Usage:
* Add the `inst/` directory from the repo to your Octave path.

## Naming conventions

Anything in a namespace with `internal` in its name is for the internal use of this package, and is not intended for use by user code.

## Documentation

See the `doc-project/` directory for notes on this project, especially for [Developer Notes](doc-project/Developer-Notes.md).

Real documentation is hopefully coming soon.

## Author

Chrono is created by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net).
