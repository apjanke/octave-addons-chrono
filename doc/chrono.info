1 Introduction
**************

     Time is an illusion.  Lunchtime doubly so.

                           — _Douglas Adams_

   This is the manual for the Chrono package version 0.3.1 for GNU
Octave.

   This document is a work in progress.  You are invited to help improve
it and submit patches.

   Chrono provides date/time functionality for Octave by supplying
Matlab-compatible implementations for the ‘datetime’, ‘duration’, and
‘calendarDuration’ classes, along with related functions.

   Chrono’s classes are designed to be convenient to use while still
being efficient.  The data representations used by Chrono are designed
to be efficient and suitable for working with large-ish data sets.  A
“large-ish” data set is one that can have millions of elements or rows,
but still fits in main computer memory.  Chrono’s main relational and
arithmetic operations are all implemented using vectorized operations on
primitive Octave data types.

   Chrono was written by Andrew Janke <<floss@apjanke.net>>.  Support
can be found on the Chrono project GitHub page
(https://github.com/apjanke/octave-chrono).

2 Getting Started
*****************

The easiest way to obtain Chrono is by using Octave’s ‘pkg’ package
manager.  To install the a development prerelease of Chrono, run this in
Octave:

     pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-chrono/releases/download/v0.3.1/chrono-0.3.1.tar.gz

   (Check the releases page at
<https://github.com/apjanke/octave-chrono/releases> to find out what the
actual latest release number is.)

   For development, you can obtain the source code for Chrono from the
project repo on GitHub at <https://github.com/apjanke/octave-chrono>.
Upon first installation, run the ‘octave_chrono_make_local’ script to
build the octfiles so Chrono will work.  Then add the ‘inst’ directory
in the repo to your Octave path.

3 Date Representation
*********************

Chrono provides the ‘datetime’ class for representing points in time.

* Menu:

* datetime Class::


File: chrono.info,  Node: datetime Class,  Up: Date Representation

3.1 ‘datetime’ Class
====================

A ‘datetime’ is an array object that represents points in time in the
familiar Gregorian calendar.

   This is an attempt to reproduce the functionality of Matlab’s
‘datetime’.  It also contains some Octave-specific extensions.

   The underlying representation is that of a datenum (a ‘double’
containing the number of days since the Matlab epoch), but encapsulating
it in an object provides several benefits: friendly human-readable
display, type safety, automatic type conversion, and time zone support.
In addition to the underlying datenum array, a ‘datetime’ inclues an
optional ‘TimeZone’ property indicating what time zone the datetimes are
in.

* Menu:

* datenum Compatibility::


File: chrono.info,  Node: datenum Compatibility,  Up: datetime Class

3.1.1 ‘datenum’ Compatibility
-----------------------------

While the underlying data representation of ‘datetime’ is compatible
with (in fact, identical to) that of datenums, you cannot directly
combine them via assignment, concatenation, or most arithmetic
operations.

   This is because of the signature of the ‘datetime’ constructor.  When
combining objects and primitive types like ‘double’, the primitive type
is promoted to an object by calling the other object’s one-argument
constructor on it.  However, the one-argument numeric-input consstructor
for ‘datetime’ does not accept datenums: it interprets its input as
datevecs instead.  This is due to a design decision on Matlab’s part;
for compatibility, Octave does not alter that interface.

   To combine ‘datetime’s with datenums, you can convert the datenums to
‘datetime’s by calling ‘datetime.ofDatenum’ or ‘datetime(x,
'ConvertFrom', 'datenum')’, or you can convert the ‘datetime’s to
datenums by accessing its ‘dnums’ field with ‘x.dnums’.

   Examples:

     dt = datetime('2011-03-04')
     dn = datenum('2017-01-01')
     [dt dn]
         ⇒ error: datenum: expected date vector containing [YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND]
     [dt datetime.ofDatenum(dn)]
         ⇒ 04-Mar-2011   01-Jan-2017

   Also, if you have a zoned ‘datetime’, you can’t combine it with a
datenum, because datenums do not carry time zone information.

4 Time Zones
************

Chrono has support for representing dates in time zones and for
converting between time zones.

   A ‘datetime’ may be "zoned" or "zoneless".  A zoneless ‘datetime’
does not have a time zone associated with it.  This is represented by an
empty ‘TimeZone’ property on the ‘datetime’ object.  A zoneless
‘datetime’ represents the local time in some unknown time zone, and
assumes a continuous time scale (no DST shifts).

   A zoned ‘datetime’ is associated with a time zone.  It is represented
by having the time zone’s IANA zone identifier (e.g.  ‘'UTC'’ or
‘'America/New_York'’) in its ‘TimeZone’ property.  A zoned ‘datetime’
represents the local time in that time zone.

   By default, the ‘datetime’ constructor creates unzoned ‘datetime’s.
To make a zoned ‘datetime’, either pass the ‘'TimeZone'’ option to the
constructor, or set the ‘TimeZone’ property after object creation.
Setting the ‘TimeZone’ property on a zoneless ‘datetime’ declares that
it’s a local time in that time zone.  Setting the ‘TimeZone’ property on
a zoned ‘datetime’ turns it back into a zoneless ‘datetime’ without
changing the local time it represents.

   You can tell a zoned from a zoneless time zone in the object display
because the time zone is included for zoned ‘datetime’s.

     % Create an unzoned datetime
     d = datetime('2011-03-04 06:00:00')
         ⇒  04-Mar-2011 06:00:00

     % Create a zoned datetime
     d_ny = datetime('2011-03-04 06:00:00', 'TimeZone', 'America/New_York')
         ⇒  04-Mar-2011 06:00:00 America/New_York
     % This is equivalent
     d_ny = datetime('2011-03-04 06:00:00');
     d_ny.TimeZone = 'America/New_York'
         ⇒  04-Mar-2011 06:00:00 America/New_York

     % Convert it to Chicago time
     d_chi.TimeZone = 'America/Chicago'
         ⇒  04-Mar-2011 05:00:00 America/Chicago

   When you combine two zoned ‘datetime’s via concatenation, assignment,
or arithmetic, if their time zones differ, they are converted to the
time zone of the left-hand input.

     d_ny = datetime('2011-03-04 06:00:00', 'TimeZone', 'America/New_York')
     d_la = datetime('2011-03-04 06:00:00', 'TimeZone', 'America/Los_Angeles')
     d_la - d_ny
         ⇒ 03:00:00

   You cannot combine a zoned and an unzoned ‘datetime’.  This results
in an error being raised.

     Warning: Normalization of "nonexistent" times (like between 02:00
     and 03:00 on a "spring forward" DST change day) is not implemented
     yet.  The results of converting a zoneless local time into a time
     zone where that local time did not exist are currently undefined.

* Menu:

* Defined Time Zones::


File: chrono.info,  Node: Defined Time Zones,  Up: Time Zones

4.1 Defined Time Zones
======================

Chrono’s time zone data is drawn from the IANA Time Zone Database
(https://www.iana.org/time-zones), also known as the “Olson Database”.
Chrono includes a copy of this database in its distribution so it can
work on Windows, which does not supply it like Unix systems do.

   You can use the ‘timezones’ function to list the time zones known to
Chrono.  These will be all the time zones in the IANA database on your
system (for Linux and macOS) or in the IANA time zone database
redistributed with Chrono (for Windows).

     Note: The IANA Time Zone Database only covers dates from about the
     year 1880 to 2038.  Converting time zones for ‘datetime’s outside
     that range is currently unimplemented.  (Chrono needs to add
     support for proleptic POSIX time zone rules, which are used to
     govern behavior outside that date range.)

5 Durations
***********

* Menu:

* duration Class::
* calendarDuration Class::


File: chrono.info,  Node: duration Class,  Next: calendarDuration Class,  Up: Durations

5.1 ‘duration’ Class
====================

A ‘duration’ represents a period of time in fixed-length seconds (or
minutes, hours, or whatever you want to measure it in.)

   A ‘duration’ has a resolution of about a nanosecond for typical
dates.  The underlying representation is a ‘double’ representing the
number of days elapsed, similar to a datenum, except it’s interpreted as
relative to some other reference point you provide, instead of being
relative to the Matlab/Octave epoch.

   You can add or subtract a ‘duration’ to a ‘datetime’ to get another
‘datetime’.  You can also add or subtract ‘durations’ to each other.


File: chrono.info,  Node: calendarDuration Class,  Prev: duration Class,  Up: Durations

5.2 ‘calendarDuration’ Class
============================

A ‘calendarDuration’ represents a period of time in variable-length
calendar components.  For example, years and months can have varying
numbers of days, and days in time zones with Daylight Saving Time have
varying numbers of hours.  A ‘calendarDuration’ does arithmetic with
"whole" calendar periods.

   ‘calendarDuration’s and ‘duration’s cannot be directly combined,
because they are not semantically equivalent.  (This may be relaxed in
the future to allow ‘duration’s to be interpreted as numbers of days
when combined with ‘calendarDuration’s.)

     d = datetime('2011-03-04 00:00:00')
         ⇒ 04-Mar-2011
     cdur = calendarDuration(1, 3, 0)
         ⇒ 1y 3mo
     d2 = d + cdur
         ⇒ 04-Jun-2012

6 Missing Functionality
***********************

Chrono is based on Matlab’s date/time API and supports most of its major
functionality.  But not all of it is implemented yet.  The missing parts
are currently:

   • POSIX time zone support for years outside the IANA time zone
     database coverage
   • Week-of-year (ISO calendar) calculations
   • Various ‘'ConvertFrom'’ forms for ‘datetime’ and ‘duration’
   • Support for LDML formatting for ‘datetime’
   • Various functions: ‘between’, ‘caldiff’, ‘dateshift’, ‘week’
   • ‘isdst’, ‘isweekend’
   • ‘calendarDuration.split’
   • ‘duration.Format’ support
   • ‘UTCOffset’ and ‘DSTOffset’ fields in the output of ‘timezones()’
   • Plotting support

   It is the author’s hope that all these will be implemented some day.

7.2.4 datetime
--------------

 -- Class: datetime

     Represents points in time using the Gregorian calendar.

     The underlying values are doubles representing the number of days
     since the Matlab epoch of "January 0, year 0".  This has a
     precision of around nanoseconds for typical times.

     A ‘datetime’ array is an array of date/time values, with each
     element holding a complete date/time.  The overall array may also
     have a TimeZone and a Format associated with it, which apply to all
     elements in the array.

     This is an attempt to reproduce the functionality of Matlab’s
     ‘datetime’.  It also contains some Octave-specific extensions.

 -- Instance Variable of datetime: ‘double’ dnums

     The underlying datenums that represent the points in time.  These
     are always in UTC.

     This is a planar property: the size of ‘dnums’ is the same size as
     the containing ‘datetime’ array object.

 -- Instance Variable of datetime: ‘char’ TimeZone

     The time zone this ‘datetime’ array is in.  Empty if this does not
     have a time zone associated with it (“unzoned”).  The name of an
     IANA time zone if this does.

     Setting the ‘TimeZone’ of a ‘datetime’ array changes the time zone
     it is presented in for strings and broken-down times, but does not
     change the underlying UTC times that its elements represent.

 -- Instance Variable of datetime: ‘char’ Format

     The format to display this ‘datetime’ in.  Currently unsupported.

     ‘NaT’ is the ‘datetime’ equivalent of ‘NaN’.  It represents a
     missing or invalid value.  ‘NaT’ values never compare equal to,
     greater than, or less than any value, including other ‘NaT’s.
     Doing arithmetic with a ‘NaT’ and any other value results in a
     ‘NaT’.

     ‘datetime’ in that it lacks Hour, Minute, and Second components.
     This is done for efficiency.

     The values in the returned broken-down time are those of the local
     time in this’ defined time zone, if it has one.

     Returns a struct with fields Year, Month, and Day.  Each field
     contains a double array of the same size as this.

-------------------

 -- Function File: OUT = milliseconds (X)
     Create a ‘duration’ X milliseconds long, or get the milliseconds in
     a ‘duration’ X.

     If input is numeric, returns a ‘duration’ array that is that many
     milliseconds in time.

     If input is a ‘duration’, converts the ‘duration’ to a number of
     milliseconds.

     Returns an array the same size as X.

7.2.13 NaT
----------

 -- Function: OUT = NaT ()
 -- Function: OUT = NaT (SZ)

     “Not-a-Time”.  Creates NaT-valued arrays.

     Constructs a new ‘datetime’ array of all ‘NaT’ values of the given
     size.  If no input SZ is given, the result is a scalar ‘NaT’.

     ‘NaT’ is the ‘datetime’ equivalent of ‘NaN’.  It represents a
     missing or invalid value.  ‘NaT’ values never compare equal to,
     greater than, or less than any value, including other ‘NaT’s.
     Doing arithmetic with a ‘NaT’ and any other value results in a
     ‘NaT’.

7.2.17 timezones
----------------

 -- Function: OUT = timezones ()
 -- Function: OUT = timezones (AREA)

     List all the time zones defined on this system.

     This lists all the time zones that are defined in the IANA time
     zone database used by this Octave.  (On Linux and macOS, that will
     generally be the system time zone database from
     ‘/usr/share/zoneinfo’.  On Windows, it will be the database
     redistributed with the Chrono package.

     If the return is captured, the output is returned as a table if
     your Octave has table support, or a struct if it does not.  It will
     have fields/variables containing column vectors:

     ‘Name’
          The IANA zone name, as cellstr.
     ‘Area’
          The geographical area the zone is in, as cellstr.

     Compatibility note: Matlab also includes UTCOffset and DSTOffset
     fields in the output; these are currently unimplemented.


File: chrono.info,  Node: years,  Prev: timezones,  Up: Functions Alphabetically

7.2.18 years
------------

 -- Function File: OUT = years (X)
     Create a ‘duration’ X years long, or get the years in a ‘duration’
     X.

     If input is numeric, returns a ‘duration’ array in units of
     fixed-length years of 365.2425 days each.

     If input is a ‘duration’, converts the ‘duration’ to a number of
     fixed-length years as double.

     Note: ‘years’ creates fixed-length years, which may not be what you
     want.  To create a duration of calendar years (which account for
     actual leap days), use ‘calyears’.
