% Now, PKG_DEL is called during the pkg('install') step. But at this point,
% the package is not listed as installed any more, so we can't detect our metadata.
% And we shouldn't bother regestering help during the install step. So, as
% a hack, look up the call stack and see if we're being called inside
% pkg('uninstall'), and if so abort the rest of package loading.

% When PKG_DEL is called, the package directory is not on the path
% any more. And it's not passed any data indicating what package is being
% loaded. So we just have to look ourselves up in the package directory
% to find our paths.
